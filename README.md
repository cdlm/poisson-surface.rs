Poisson point distribution, in Rust
===================================

This is a small implementation of [Bridson's Poisson Disc algorithm][bridson], inspired by Mike Bostock's examples [here][bostock1] and [here][bostock2].

But really it's just a pretext for fiddling with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and getting my head around it's type system.
